      body: "Labels are the subcategories for medicines, procedures, and protocols. Medicines, procedures, and protocols all have their own labels and can be customized to meet your agencyâ€™s needs. Labels only need to be created one time and then they will be optional when creating a medicine, procedure, or protocol. Labels can be sorted by position, this allows the documentation to appear in an organized way that team members can easily understand.",
      example:
        "In the example gif you can see how a medicine label named 'Actions' is created and set to position 1. Along with that, it shows other custom labels that have been created.",

      example:

The tool allows you to create custom flow charts for your team to understand the workflow of any given topic. This powerful tool is intuitive and simple to use.The flow charts are viewable on mobile and feel navigating them is intuitive.",
      example:
        "In the example gif you can see the user creating a very simple flow chart. The first node says 'add dextrose' and the second yellow node says 'observe' and the two are connected with a moving line. This is not intended to be a real world example, but simply highlights how easy it is to create a flow chart.",

This 5 step process is all that is needed to create a single medicine, procedure, or protocol guideline. In fact, labels can be ignored once you have them setup; simply add details, add a table, and add a flowchart to create detailed documentation for your team. ",
